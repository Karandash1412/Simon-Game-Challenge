# Simon-Game-Challenge

This repository contains the starting files for the Simon Game Challenge, a fun project to practice your JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills.

## 🚀 What is the Simon Game?

The Simon Game is a classic memory game where the player repeats a sequence of lights and sounds displayed by the computer. The sequence gets progressively longer with each round, challenging the player's memory and reflexes.

## 📝 Challenge:

This challenge involves completing the missing JavaScript code to implement the full functionality of the Simon Game. You will need to:

- `Generate random sequences of tile clicks.`
- `Play sounds associated with each tile.`
- `Track user input and compare it with the generated sequence.`
- `Handle game logic such as scoring, round progression, and ending the game on incorrect input.`
- `Enhance the user experience through visual effects and sounds.`
